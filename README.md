# Cor

This repository is not for code. Instead, it's mainly to have a central place
to discuss the "Cor" proposal to bring modern OO to the core of the Perl
language. 

You're probably looking for the [Wiki](https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/wiki) as it is intended as
the canonical place to understand the current state of the Cor project.

[You can file issues](https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/issues) to address your
particular concerns and get feedback.
